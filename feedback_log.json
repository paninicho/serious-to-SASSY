    "originalText": "The cloud security firm said it identified security issues in default IAM roles created by AWS services like SageMaker, Glue, EMR, and Lightsail. A similar flaw has also been unearthed in a popular open-source framework called Ray, which automatically creates a default IAM role (ray-autoscaler-v1) with the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.\n\nWhat's concerning about these IAM roles is that while they are intended for something specific, they could be abused to perform administrative actions and break isolation boundaries between services, effectively allowing an attacker who has a foothold in the environment to move laterally across services.\n\nThese attacks go beyond bucket monopoly attacks, which revolve around a scenario where a threat actor could take advantage of predictable S3 bucket naming patterns to set up buckets in unused AWS regions and ultimately gain control over the contents of the bucket when a legitimate customer starts using services like CloudFormation, Glue, EMR, SageMaker, ServiceCatalog, and CodeStar.\n\n\"In this case, an attacker who gains access to a default service role with AmazonS3FullAccess doesn't even need to guess bucket names remotely,\" the researchers explained.\n\n\"They can use their existing privileges to search the account for buckets used by other services using the naming patterns, modify assets like CloudFormation templates, EMR scripts, and SageMaker resources, and move laterally across services within the same AWS account.\"\n\nPut differently, an IAM role within an AWS account with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions has read/write access to every S3 bucket and modifies various AWS services, effectively turning the role into a powerful method for lateral movement and privilege escalation.",

There's a similar mess happening with this open-source thingy called Ray, which is out here creating default IAM roles (ray-autoscaler-v1) with AmazonS3FullAccess like it’s no biggie. 💀\n\nBut hold up, here’s the kicker: these roles are supposed to be on their best behavior, but nah, they can totally be hijacked to do admin-level chaos and smash through service barriers like a pro hacker. Basically, if a baddie gets in, they can slide around all sneaky-like and take over everything.\n\nAnd it doesn’t stop there, babes. This is way beyond those basic bucket monopoly attacks where villains play the S3 bucket name game in unused AWS regions to snatch control. Nope, these attackers don’t even need to play guessing games with bucket names anymore. 🙄\n\nThe researchers are like, “Yo, if someone snags a default service role with AmazonS3FullAccess, they can just flex their privileges to snoop around for other buckets, tweak stuff like CloudFormation templates, EMR scripts, and SageMaker resources, and just vibe through services in the same AWS account.”\n\nTranslation? An IAM role with AmazonS3FullAccess is like a VIP pass to every S3 bucket, letting you remix AWS services like a DJ at Coachella, giving wannabe hackers a slick way to level up and run riot. 🔥💻 #StayWoke #CloudChaos",
